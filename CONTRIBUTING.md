# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! All useful contributions are
welcome and encouraged.

Please discuss significant changes via an issue before starting to write code.

## Style
Each commit should be run through `rustfmt`/`cargo fmt`, and should generally
only do one thing. Commit messages don't need to be very detailed, but should be
unambiguous and give a good idea of their content.

Where practical, please add tests with any submission.

## Licensing
You agree that all contributions will be generally licensed under the
[ISC license](LICENSE).

## Conduct
All interactions with the project must abide by the
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT). Failure to comply may result in sanctions up
to and including a ban from the project.
